The scripts in this folder were used for local downstream analyses using files obtained from analyses performed on an HPC cluster as input. The script Choquet_2024_script_for_downstream_data_analyses_and_plots.ipynb contains the code for identifying allele-specific splicing orders using a chi-square contingency test and Euclidean distances. Most other analyses and all the figures in the manuscript were made using Choquet_2024_script_for_downstream_data_analyses_and_plots.Rmd, except for Fig.4B made in Choquet_2024_script_for_downstream_data_analyses_and_plots.ipynb.
