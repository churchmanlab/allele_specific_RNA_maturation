# Allele-specific nascent RNA maturation

This repository contains the scripts used to perform the analyses in the manuscript "Genetic regulation of nascent RNA maturation revealed by direct RNA nanopore sequencing" (Choquet et al. Genome Res 2024), including analysis of allele-specific splicing order and poly(A) tail length using direct RNA nanopore sequencing of nascent RNA from lymphoblastoid cells.
