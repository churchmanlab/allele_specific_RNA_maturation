This directory contains the scripts that were used on an HPC cluster. They are numbered according to the order in which they were run. For several steps, bash scripts are used to call the python scripts with the same number. 

- For basecalling and alignment, use scripts 01 to 08.
- For assignment of reads to alleles, use scripts 10 and 11.
- For allele-specific splicing order analysis, use scripts 09, 12 and 13.
- For allele-specific poly(A) tail length and APA analyses, use scripts 14 to 17.
- All other scripts were used for downstream analyses described in the manuscript.
